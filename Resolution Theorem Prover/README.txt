For my program, the main file to run is prover.py, this file depends on and imports
all the other files (lexer.py, unifier.py, compare.py, intern.py, dupeclause.py,
and theorems.py) to run. (The zip should contain all these files)

Once you have ran the prover.py file, you will be prompted to enter a theorem
and a starting goal location in the command line. To execute, simply type in the
theorem followed by the starting goal location.

Full examples:

howling 6
rr 7
customs 7
harmonia 7
user 8

My program will then output the theorem and the resolution steps.
